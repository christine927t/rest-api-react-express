# REST API with React with Basic Authentication

## Thanks for taking a look at my app! 
This React app is a list of courses for a school directory. 
Once a user has created a new account, (or an existing account is signed in) they can add a new course to the course list, update and delete their own courses. It uses Basic Authentication to authenticate the user and determine which routes a user can and cannot see. It also provides error handling for those unexpected situations that do arise ;) Enjoy!

To get started, please do the following in your terminal...
Navigate to the client folder and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

In a separate tab, navigate to the api folder and run:
```
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to start interacting with my app!
