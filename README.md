# REST API with React with Basic Authentication

## Thanks for taking a look at my app! This React app lets users create a new account, add a new course to the course list, update and delete their own courses. It uses Basic Authentication to authenticate the user and determine which routes a user can and cannot see.

To get started, please run the following from your terminal:
```
npm install
npm run seed
npm start
```

Then navigate to http://http://localhost:3000/ to start interacting with my app!
